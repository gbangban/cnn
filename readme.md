# Detection of metastatic cancer tissue using deep neural networks

This repo contains a python notebook detailing the creation of a deep learning model trained to detect cancerous tissue.  It is the submission to the [2018 kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/histopathologic-cancer-detection).

This notebook will only function on Kaggle for now, as a full migration would require duplication of all of the training data into this repo.

Further details can be found in the notebook itself.
